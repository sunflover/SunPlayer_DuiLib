    Notify Icon Plugin v0.2 by brainsucker and Afrow UK
    ```````````````````````````````````````````````````

Allows you to add your icon to taskbar notification area (sometimes erroneously 
called the "tray." (c) MSDN). Also could remove installer caption from taskbar
on minimizing and more...

Two examples exist under Examples\NotifyIcon (if you installed the plugin Zip
correctly :) )

To use:

NotifyIcon::Icon Flags Arguments

Flags is a string of letters with special meaning. Some of such flags need 
some arguments to be passed, in this case they must follow flags specification
in the order flags describe them. :) I never was the master of explaining how
any of my plugins works ;)

So, the flags:
        a       -       add icon*   
        m       -       modify icon*
        r       -       remove icon
                * - these flags will be autodetected, but could be overrided

The following 4 flags could be inverted with '!' char before them (to reset them
to the default state). In this case ('!p') the p flag requires no argument.

        x       -       show taskbar item in minimized state (by default no)
        y       -       show NotifyIcon in normal state (by default no)
        z       -       hide NotifyIcon in minimized state (by default no)

        p       -       indicate progress as tip (requires argument, tip format.
                        Should look like "it's a progress tip %d%%" or something
                        like that. %% adds % sign, and %d places progress value.

        .       - by default icon is loaded as 16x16 icon, by specifing this
                  flag you are stimulating windows to use it internal 
                  mechanics to select right icon. Should be used before
                  (i, s, or f) flags

        i       - icon as integer (installer resource icon) (1 arg integer)
        s       - icon as integer (system icon) (1 arg integer)
        f       - icon as file (1 arg file name)
        h       - icon as handle (1 arg handle - integer)

        t       - tip (1 arg - string)

        b       - balloon tooltip without marks (2 args, Title and Tip itself)
        n       - balloon tooltip with INFO mark (2 args, Title and Tip itself)
        w       - balloon tooltip with WARNING mark (2 args, Title and Tip itself)
        e       - balloon tooltip with ERROR mark (2 args, Title and Tip itself)

        o       - set the baloon tooltip timeout (1 arg integer timeout in ms)
                  windows allows values between 10 and 30.

The following 2 flags are for catching mouse click on the icon to execute NSIS
code. See Examples\NotifyIcon\NotifyIconClick.nsi for a complete example.

        c       - add click event for the icon. This makes the installer go to
                  the next NSIS page when the icon is clicked, allowing the
                  leave function to be called.
        d       - Use Pop $Var after plugin call to return click value.
                  Possible values of $Var:
                    0 - Icon was not clicked (i.e. Next button was clicked instead)
                    1 - Icon clicked, installer is in minimized state
                    2 - Icon clicked, installer is in restored state

Tip 1. Ballon tooltips are available only at version 5.0 of shell controls.
At lower versions they will be ignored.
Tip 2. Don't forget using /NOUNLOAD on plugin calls (beside last call, usually
with "r" flag).

Example:
1)   NotifyIcon::Icon /NOUNLOAD "yitb" 103 "Just a tip" "Balloon!" "Cool!" 

     Create notify icon (will always be at tray), with default installer icon.   

2)   NotifyIcon::Icon /NOUNLOAD "fbp" "icon.ico" "Cool Installer" "Installation started" "Completed %d%%"

     Create notify icon from icon.ico, show startup balloon, and use progress
     as icon tip.

3)   NotifyIcon::Icon /NOUNLOAD "!pt" "Tip is back!"

     Remove progress tips and redefine your tip.

4)   NotifyIcon::Icon "r"
        
     Remove icon from tray.
     Can cause crashes if called in the wrong place in your script.
     Ideally should be called in .onGUIEnd, but works in other places.
